> The diagram accurately shows the general flow of Go's module installation process, but a few additions could make it more comprehensible:
>
> 1. The Module Proxy (proxy.golang.org) interaction could be clearer by:
>    - Showing that it's optional (some companies use private proxies or direct GitHub access)
>    - Indicating that it serves as a cache and checksum database
>    - Showing the fallback path when proxy is not available
>
> 2. The versioning aspect could be more explicit by:
>    - Showing how go.mod and go.sum files are involved
>    - Indicating where version selection happens
>    - Showing how semantic versioning is resolved
>
> 3. The module cache step ("git clone into module cache") could be enhanced by:
>    - Showing that it's actually storing in $GOPATH/pkg/mod
>    - Indicating that it's a persistent cache
>    - Showing how the module verification process works
>
> 4. Additional helpful elements:
>    - Include error handling paths
>    - Show interaction with checksum database
>    - Indicate where dependency resolution happens
>    - Show how replace and exclude directives in go.mod affect the flow
>
> The basic flow is correct, but these additions would make it more educational for developers learning about Go's module system. Would you like me to create an enhanced version of this diagram?
